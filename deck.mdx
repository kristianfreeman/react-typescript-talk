# `TypeScript`, meet `React`

---

# üëã Hi, I'm Kristian

---

## @signalnerve

---

## Software engineer, technical trainer, community organizer

---

## Working with React since 2014

---

## This talk is the synthesis of two different situations

---

1. Teaching JavaScript
2. Writing JavaScript

---

## Everyone has things that irk them about JavaScript

---

## If you teach JavaScript, these things generally come up organically

---

- Scope
- Context
- Types

---

# üíÄ Types üíÄ

---

## Where are the types?

---

## _In React:_ what are the props? What is the state?

---

> Thinking about our application's input and output is what allows us to understand our React code, and what (hopefully) makes it bug-free

---

## But that's hard in JavaScript!

---

### JavaScript has allowed us to build and ship things to a global audience faster than ever before, but the language itself may still be the weakest part of the toolchain

---

## In 2016, I began hearing about TypeScript, and after exploring it a bit, was completely thrilled with the results

---

## This talk

1. The details: writing TypeScript day-to-day
2. Using it with React
3. Next steps: exploring more about TypeScript, moving your app to TypeScript

---

## The details

---

# Why even use TypeScript?

---

> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

---

## Typed

---

## Type-checking: a function or variable has a type that must be defined and "correct"

---

```javascript
const myName = "Kristian Freeman";
```

---

```typescript
const nameLength = name => console.log(name.length);
nameLength(myName) // 16
```

---

## An architecture requirement appears! A name is two fields: `first` and `last`

---

```typescript
const name = {
  first: "Kristian",
  last: "Freeman"
}
```

---

```javascript
nameLength(name) // undefined
```

---

# üíÄ Types üíÄ

---

## A code requirement: nameLength function takes a _string_

---

```typescript
const nameLength = (name: string) => console.log(name.length);
```

---

## The killer feature: compilation errors

---

```
name.ts:6:12 - error TS2345: Argument of
  type '{ first: string; last: string; }' is not
  assignable to parameter of type 'string'.

6 nameLength(myName);
             ~~~~~~
```

---

# üòç Types üòç

---

## Superset of JavaScript

---

## Any JavaScript _is_ valid TypeScript

---

## Progressively transition your application code over to TypeScript

---

## Use "current" JavaScript: **ES6**, **async functions**, **decorators**

---

## Compiles to JavaScript

---

## Still plain JavaScript output

---

## Any TypeScript work stays in development, and it can integrate with your current build processes

---

## The details

---

## TypeScript contains a number of _basic types_

---

```typescript
// Numbers
let myAge: number = 24;
let gasPrice: number = 2.95;
```

---

```typescript
// Booleans
let isPresenting: boolean = true;
let isEating: boolean = false;
```

---

```typescript
// Strings
let firstName: string = "Kristian";
```

---

```typescript
// Arrays
let languages: string[] = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Elixir"];
let languages: Array<string> = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Elixir"];
```

---

```typescript
// Tuples
let information: [string, string, number] = ["Kristian", "Freeman", 24];
```

---

```typescript
let information: [string, string, number];

// Error
information = ["Kristian", 24];
```

---

```typescript
// Enum
enum State {WA, OR, CA}
let california: State = State.CA;
```

---

```typescript
// Indexed enums
enum State {WA, OR, CA}

// Notice: `string`, not `State`
let california: string = State[2]
console.log(california) // "CA"
```

---

## Type inference

---

```typescript
let myAge = 24; // type is `number`
let myName = "Kristian Freeman"; // type is `string`
```

---

```typescript
let myAge = 24;
myAge.toUppercase();

// MyAge.ts(2,7): error TS2339: Property 'toUpperCase'
//   does not exist on type 'number'.
```

---

# Interfaces

---

## Functions and variables _conform_ to interfaces

---

```typescript
interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
}
```

---

```typescript
// OK
const me: Person = {
  firstName: "Kristian",
  lastName: "Freeman",
  age: 25
}

// Error
const you: Person = {
  firstName: "Other",
  lastName: "Person"
}
```

---

```typescript
interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age?: number;
}
```

---

```typescript
// OK
const me: Person = {
  firstName: "Kristian",
  lastName: "Freeman",
  age: 25
}

// OK
const you: Person = {
  firstName: "Other",
  lastName: "Person"
}
```

---

## Classes combine interfaces with object-oriented behavior

---

```typescript
class Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
  constructor(first: string, last: string, age: number) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

---

```typescript
let me = new Person("Kristian", "Freeman", 24);
console.log(me.firstName);
console.log(me.lastName);
me.age + 10;
```

---

## In practice: type inference handles most of what you need, but progressively defining explicit types isn't a bad idea

---

# Now for the practical: moving a React component to TypeScript

---

> In React, we reason about how our components work by asking: what are the props? What is the state?

---

## TypeScript doubles down on that approach: explicitly define interfaces for prop and state

---

```javascript
// JavaScript

class HelloComponent extends React.Component = {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.message}</p>;
  }
}
```

---

```typescript
// TypeScript

class HelloComponent: React.Component<Props, State> = {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.message}</p>;
  }
}
```

---

## Defining the component props interface

---

```typescript
interface IProps {
  message: string;
}
```

---

```typescript
class HelloComponent: React.Component<IProps, {}> = {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.message}</p>;
  }
}
```

---

```typescript
interface IProps {
  message: string; // required
  paragraphClass?: string; // optional
}
```

---

```typescript
class HelloComponent: React.Component<IProps, {}> = {
  render() {
    const { message, paragraphClass } = this.props;
    return <p className={paragraphClass}>
      {message}
    </p>;
  }
}
```

---

```typescript
<HelloComponent message={0} /> // Error
<HelloComponent message="Hello, world!" /> // OK
```

---

```typescript
<HelloComponent
  message="Hello, world!"
  paragraphClass={0} /> // Error

<HelloComponent
  message="Hello, world!"
  paragraphClass="big" /> // OK
```

---

## What about open-source projects?

---

## The React community has an incredible amount of open-source components, libraries, and more

---

## _A lot_ of them support TypeScript, but if they don't...

---

## DefinitelyTyped repo

---

```
yarn add @types/react @types/react-dom
```

---

## Community maintained type definitions for projects

---

## Let's do this! The TypeScript migration process

---

### `ts-loader`

---

## TypeScript Handbook: "Integrating with Build Tools"

---

1. Batch rename all `.js` files to `.ts` (or `.tsx` for `.jsx` files)
2. Run those through webpack
3. Install `ts-lint`

---

## ts-lint encourages good TypeScript code via community-agreed upon rules

---

### Typescript Book
#### github.com/basarat/typescript-book

---

### Example React + Redux TypeScript project
#### gitlab.com/bytesizedxyz/thewidgetcompany-typescript

---

## Shout-out to Visual Studio Code
- _built-in_ TypeScript support
- easy `ts-lint` plugin installation

---
